Create a stepper waveform where an object is accelerating 
as quickly as possible to max speed, cruising as long as possible, 
then decelerating as quickly as possible. Instructions can be 
interrupted and the algorithm will calculate the next travel 
taking into account the current position and velocity.

Basic physics equations
d = 1/2 at^2
t = sqrt(2d/a)
v = at
t = v/a

Variables used either internally or in the data structures
p_start: absolute starting position
t_start: absolute start time
v0: initial velocity
dir: direction (1 or -1) from starting position to destination

dd_0: distance it takes to decelerate from initial velocity v0
d_accel: accel absolute distance
d_cruise: cruise absolute distance
d_decel: decel absolute distance

dd_accel: accel distance delta
dd_cruise: cruise distance delta
dd_decel: decel distance delta

d_dest: distance to destination
dtotal: total distance for a symetrical profile used for finding accel/decel midpoint

dt_0: time it takes to decelerate from initial velocity v0
dt_reverse: delta time to reverse direction
dt_accel: delta accel time
dt_cruise: delta cruise time
dt_decel: delta decel time

t_accel: time to stop accel
t_cruise: time to stop cruise
t_decel: time to stop decel

maxv: max velocity (constant)
ttop: time to max velocity
dtop: distance to max velocity
